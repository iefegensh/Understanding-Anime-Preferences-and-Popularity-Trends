# Understanding-Anime-Preferences-and-Popularity-Trends
This is the final project for Info201. 

anime.csv and animes_2.csv are original csvs. After using left join, we made a merged_anime_data.csv to do the following analysis. For the Data Wrangling part, we create a new column called new_category. In this category, we consider anime with score larger than 6 as high. Otherwise, it would be considered as low. In addition, to make it easy to plot. We made a new continous columns called year. Therefore, we could analyze the related information and analysis them more directly.

To be more specific,
> Final_project.R: to do the data wrangling
> merged_anime_data.csv: dataset we used to create shiny app
> app.R: to create shiny app with several interactive pages
