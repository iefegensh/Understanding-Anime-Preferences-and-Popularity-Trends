Many phenomenal anime have captivated audiences around the world with their vibrant colors, intricate storylines and unique characters.  They affect audiences in different ways-mapping political science, exploring absolute and relative freedom, and visualizing youth literature.An anime that discusses camping can make young people love going out and making friends and camping in the wilderness. They would enjoy the winding rivers, steep cliffs and charming flowers like lilies and daisies. In the rivers, they could go swimming, fishing and boating. Then, they would hike through the deciduous, coniferous, and the tundra regions; an anime about a band plants a musical dream in people's minds; an anime about relationship might teach people how to get along well with others, how to understand and respect each other, how to focus on the things that we have in common and tolerate the differences, how to think in othersâ€™ perspectives; an anime set in reality can cause tourism to flourish and promote the commercialization of an entire region, etc.But what determines the success of some anime works? Is it the genre, the narrative of the unique art style? What exactly is the kernel of phenomenal anime that influences society and people? With platforms like MyAnimeList, we now have a treasure trove of data to delve into these questions."),

Imagine the world we live in, whether there are things that have happened to you that make you feel a lot of emotions, whether there are some things that make you feel the same way when you watch them, influencing your behavior, hobbies and even the trajectory of your life. Then anime may be the way to visualize and universalize these stories of love, adventure, despair and hope, sublimating them and touching every viewer. This is the world of anime, a Japanese cultural marvel that has touched millions of people around the globe. But what makes an anime stand out from the crowd in a sea of stories? Our project, Exploring Anime Preferences and Trends, seeks to answer this question. By delving into MyAnimeList's data, we aim to uncover patterns, preferences, and trends in the world of anime.
